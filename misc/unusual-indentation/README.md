# Unusual indentation

## Difficulty rating (1-5, 5 is very hard), Category

1, Misc.

## General description of challenge (NOT GIVEN TO PLAYERS)

This challenge is based on the esoteric language called whitespace where the syntax of the language is entirely based on whitespace characters like, “ “, “\n” and “\t”. We embed this code into another language with no significant whitespace like C or Rust. We let the players figure out that this is whitespace but also compiles as another language.

The point of the challenge is to teach players about the interesting world of esoteric programming languages like whitespace which are only made for a laugh.

## Technical resources

The challenge doesn’t need any hardware and just serves a zip file to players calles `meow.zip`.

## Description of challenge (Given to players)

I found this rust source code while surfing the internet :O It seems to have a very unusual indentation. Could you figure out what’s going on?
Flag format: DISOBEY\[a-zA-Z0-9_\]

## Flag

DISOBEY\[WOw_5o_ES0T3Ric\] (Actually in the comp. the implementation was a bit broken so the closest one gets to the full solution is DISOBEY\[WOw_5o_ES0T3Ric\])

## Solution

1. Download the file
2. Look at the source code and try to understand the code (and patterns in the indentation)
3. From open sources find the whitespace language
4. Find whitespace language compiler and run the source code
5. get flag
