## Description

Hi, Iâ€™m father SHA. The leader of this church of the holy hash.
Please treat yourself to a bit of hash browns and some sausage hash.
In this church we worship the holy hash and we ascend to hash heaven by finding collision in it.
The only ones who have succeeded in it are two very good friends Euler and Totient. Can you ascend?
