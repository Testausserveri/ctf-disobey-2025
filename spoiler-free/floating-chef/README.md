# Floating chef

## Description

I am Cornolius the third, a son of Cornolius the second and we have the most prestigious restaurant in the world with three Michelin stars.
My father left this secret recipe for me when he died but I am still confused about the contents of this recipe.
Can you help me decode it as a fellow chef, a cyberchef?
