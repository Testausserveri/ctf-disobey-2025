## Installation

## Description

Hi!! Wow, you have now ascended from the mortal plane and now you are in hash heaven!
Good job! Here everything is bliss and we are in paradise.
Although... There is still a peculiar talking safe in here which contains some secret which is yet unknown to all of us?
I think I heard the Holy hash saying something about a flag.
I am not sure what that means but the last one who opened was named Hellman.
Do you want to take a crack at opening the safe?

Flag format: DISOBEY\[[A-Za-z0-9_]*\]

`nc <server addr> <port>`  
`nc localhost 5788`
